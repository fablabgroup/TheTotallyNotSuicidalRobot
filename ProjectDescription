We plan to construct a “suicide robot” capable of both navigating surfaces and detecting edges or drops. When a drop is identified, the robot will race at top speed towards it and “jump” off. It will require the use of a sensor, such as UV or IR (ultra-violet or infra-red) a board such as arduino or raspberryPi, possibly a shield,  motor(s) and a power source. The body will consist of a robust wedge shaped body housing the electronics, likely constructed of ply-wood, 3D printed wheels, pre-fabed tracks and probably some vinyl decals for fun! While the main purpose of robot is humorous, it provides a number of challenging and specific design problems that solving will cover all elements of the Principles of Digital Fabrication course and several of the tools available in FabLab.
